## üì¶ Tools Included

### 1. `mcd`

**Functionality:** 

Searches for directories using **partial** and **case-insensitive matching**, then changes into the chosen directory. If multiple matches are found, it lets you pick which one to switch to.

**Syntax:**  
```bash
mcd [partial_folder_name]
```

### 2. `run`

**Functionality:**
Searches for files in the **current directory** by matching **part of their name (case-insensitive)**, then run the selected file. If multiple matches are found, it lets you choose which one to run.

**Syntax:**
```bash
run [partial_file_name]
```

### 3. `update-tools`

**Functionality:**  
Fetches and applies the latest updates from the Linux-Tools GitHub repository.
